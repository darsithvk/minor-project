DESIGN

The circuit is really simple. First we will look at the RGB LED half of the sensor. It is simply a common cathode RGB LED connected to pins 2,3, and 4 of the Arduino with a resistor going out to ground. This will allow us to turn each of the LEDs within the package on and off individually when we need to. On the other side of the circuit we have a Cds photocell being fed 5 volts from the arduino. combined with the resistor going out to ground.





WORKING

First the program will check the balance, then it will check the colour, and then it will print the colour to the serial port so we can see the values that it read.

Let`s explore the first private function, checkBalance,if the balanceSet value (a boolean value) is set to false, then it makes a call to a secondary function called setBalance, where we set the white and black balancing readings.

Once our balancing numbers have been set, we go on to finally read the colour. The function is basically the same as setBalance,, with the addition of the math that balances the reading.

We will also need to add our function getReading, otherwise our sketch won`t have real values. This function just allows us to take a few readings and average them out.

Now we have a colour read into our colour holding array, all we need to do now is output it to the screen.
